# Additional Authors

## Background
The copyright for the original code is held by Daniel Silverstone. The
copyright of all patches and contributes are held by their respective
owners, and will be listed here separate from the original license's
copyright statement.

## Interpretation
The original code must contain an attribute to Mr. Stone. That is the
primary condition of the license. While it would be more convenient if
Mr. Silverstone would consider re-licensing his code under GPL-3, that
is currently not the case. Therefore, while I am not a lawyer, I believe
that contributions to such a codebase can be made under GPL-3, and will
be listed here as such.

## How to Contribute
